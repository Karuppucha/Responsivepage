        <p>On 26 June 2009, Vijay launched his fan club, Vijay Makkal <br>Iyakkam, in Pudukkottai to carry out philanthropic activities.[2][3] <br>The organization supported the AIADMK-led Alliance in the 2011<br> legislative assembly elections. The fan club organization<br> contested the local body elections in Tamil Nadu in October<br> 2021, securing victory in 115 out of the 169 seats where it took<br> part.[4][5] On 2 February 2024, Vijay announced the launch of his <br>political party, Tamilaga Vettri Kazhagam, and stated its intent to <br>enter the 2026 elections.[6][7] Political analysts suggested that<br> the TVK party might expand its reach to other neighbouring<br> states, in the near future.[8] Vijay called the Citizenship<br> (Amendment) Act of 2019 as "unacceptable" as it would disrupt <br>the social and religious harmony of the nation</p>
